This file briefly describes the content of the the ad-micp module. Inside
the root folder, you will find the following folders:

* examples,
* publications,
* models, and
* utility.

In addition, this file (Contents.txt), a copy of the license (LICENSE.txt),
and the README (README.md).

The example folder contains two commented scripts to demonstrate how to
set up different flow system simulations using this module:

* runMICP1DCase.m and
* runMICP3DCase.m.

The publications folder contains two folders for reproducing the numerical
results in the manuscripts:

* paper_A and
* paper_B.

The paper_A folder contains the following folder and scripts:

* co2_assessment,
* micp_1Dfhs.m,
* micp_2Dfhcs.m,
* micp_2Dfhrs.m,
* micp_2Dfls.m,
* micp_2Dfvrs.m, and
* micp_3Dfls.m.

The co2_assessment folder contains the following scripts:

* CO2Model.m
* equationsCO2.m,
* getFluxAndPropsCO2.m, and
* getFluxAndPropsWater.m.

The paper_B folder contains the following scripts and folder:

* micp_mrst_opm.m and
* micp_opm_vtk.

The micp_opm_vtk folder contains the data obtained from the OPM simulations
to be used for plotting.

The models folder contains the parent class for declaring the MICP model:

* MICPModel.m.

Finally, in the utility folder, you will find the following functions:

* checkCloggingMICP.m,
* equationsMICP.m,
* getDispersionAnddpWMICP.m,
* getFluxAndPropsMICP.m,
* getPlotAfterStepCO2.m,
* getPlotAfterStepMICP.m, and
* mrsttovtk.m.
