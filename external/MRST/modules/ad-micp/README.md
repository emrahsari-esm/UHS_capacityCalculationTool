# ad-micp: A module to study CO2 leakage remediation by microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP)

<img src="micp-gif.gif" width="830" height="400">

## Description
MICP is a new and sustainable technology which utilizes biochemical
processes to create barriers by calcium carbonate cementation; therefore,
this technology has a potential to be used for sealing leakage zones in
geological formations. We have implemented a mathematical model for MICP
suitable for field-scale studies. Further information on the mathematical
model can be found in the two publications [A, B] in the "Cite" part of
this README.

The numerical examples accompanying this module are:
* runMICP1DCase.m and
* runMICP3DCase.m.

In addition, this module includes scripts to run the studies in [A, B].

The ad-micp module is compatible with the (freely available) MATLAB
Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) provided by SINTEF Digital, see
http://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/.

See the Wiki for an extended description, information regarding changes
respect to previous releases, and using this module in macOS with GNU
Octave.

## Requirements
* MRST (Tested version: 2023a)
* MATLAB (Tested version: R2023a) or GNU Octave (Tested version: 8.1.0)

## Installation (MATLAB/GNU Octave)
* Set the folder's name to 'ad-micp'.
* Move the folder inside the 'modules' folder in MRST.
* Run the 'startup.m' file in MRST.

## Getting started
