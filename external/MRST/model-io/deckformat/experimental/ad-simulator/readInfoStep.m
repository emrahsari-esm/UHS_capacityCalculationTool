function stepinfo = readInfoStep(fname)
%Read OPM Flow's INFOSTEP File
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   stepinfo  = readInfoStep(fname)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   fname - File name of INFOSTEP file.  Full or partial path.  Passed to
%           function FOPEN using mode 'rt'.  File columns assumed to be
%           separated by whitespace, meaning this function will break if
%           the unit strings are separated from the column names too.
%
% RETURNS:
%   stepinfo - Structure with fields inferred from the column headers.
