# UHS Capacity Calculation Tool

## Overview
This MATLAB GUI application calculates the **hydrogen storage capacity** of depleted gas reservoirs. It uses the **Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)** to build reservoir models and perform capacity calculations.

## Features
- User-friendly MATLAB GUI
- MRST-powered reservoir modeling
- Hydrogen storage capacity estimation
- Analyzing gas composition as storage cycles are reperated 

## Requirements
- **MATLAB** (Recommended: R2021a or later)
- **MRST** (Available at: [MRST GitHub](https://github.com/SINTEF-AppliedCompSci/MRST))

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/emrahsari-esm/UHS_capacityCalculationTool
